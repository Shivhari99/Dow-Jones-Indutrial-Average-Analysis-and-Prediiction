The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the country's second-oldest stock market index, after the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA). The DJIA was created as a proxy for the US economy's overall strength. The DJIA, also known as "the Dow," is one of the most widely followed stock market indices in the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of a diverse group of companies, all of which are blue-chip companies that routinely generate substantial profits.
